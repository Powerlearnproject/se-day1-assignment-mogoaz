#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It combines principles from computer science, engineering, and project management to create reliable and efficient software that meets user needs.
Why is Software Engineering Important?
Powering Technology – Almost everything we use today, from smartphones to banking systems, relies on software. Software engineering ensures these systems work smoothly.
Efficiency & Performance – Well-engineered software runs faster, uses fewer resources, and delivers a better user experience.
Scalability – Companies need software that can grow with their business. Proper engineering ensures software can handle increasing users and data without crashing.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Development of Early Programming Languages (1950s–1960s): The birth of programming languages like Fortran, Lisp, and COBOL marked a huge milestone in the evolution of software engineering. Before this, programming was done directly with machine code, which was tedious and error-prone. These high-level programming languages made coding more accessible and efficient, setting the stage for more sophisticated software development. It was a shift from assembly-level thinking to focusing more on problem-solving, enabling the growth of complex systems.

The Birth of Software Engineering as a Discipline (1968): In 1968, the term "software engineering" was officially coined during the NATO Software Engineering Conference. Up until then, software development was often seen as more of an art than a science. But as systems grew more complex, there was a realization that a more structured approach was needed. This conference helped lay the groundwork for applying engineering principles to software, pushing for better methodologies, formal processes, and a more professional approach to building software. It also helped pave the way for the idea of software as a critical asset for businesses and society.

The Agile Movement (2001): Fast forward to the early 2000s, when the software engineering world saw the birth of Agile development. Agile introduced a new mindset focused on collaboration, flexibility, and rapid iteration, replacing the traditional "waterfall" model where software was developed in long, rigid phases. Agile methods like Scrum and Kanban emphasized continuous improvement, customer feedback, and adaptive planning. This shift was a game-changer, especially for companies that needed to quickly adapt to changes in technology and market demands. Agile is now a standard approach used across the tech industry and has influenced how teams develop and maintain software.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: This is the initial phase where the project scope, objectives, and requirements are defined. It’s about understanding what the software is meant to achieve, who will use it, and what resources are needed. Planning helps set clear expectations and provides a blueprint for the entire project.

Design: During the design phase, the architecture of the software is created. This includes high-level designs (like how the software components will interact) and detailed designs (like user interfaces or database structures). The design phase is crucial because it establishes how the software will function before development begins.

Development (or Coding): This is where the actual software is built. Developers write the code according to the designs and specifications laid out in the previous phase. It’s one of the most time-consuming stages, where the core functionality is developed and integrated.

Testing and deployment: Once the software is developed, it goes through testing to ensure it works as expected. This includes checking for bugs, ensuring the features perform correctly, and verifying that the software meets the requirements. Testing can happen in various ways, like unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a traditional, linear approach where the project is completed in distinct phases: requirement gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance while Agile is an iterative approach where projects are broken into smaller chunks called "sprints." The team works on these sprints, delivering parts of the product regularly. Waterfall can be used where the project is well-defined with little chance of changes. For example, building a bridge or developing a medical device where regulations and standards are strict. While agile can be used  When the project is more exploratory, or the customer’s needs might change over time. For example, developing a new app where you expect user feedback to guide the next steps.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software applications. Their main job is to build the product according to the requirements.
A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer ensures the software is reliable, functional, and bug-free. They are responsible for testing the software from the user’s perspective and making sure everything works smoothly.
Project Manager: Plans, organizes, and monitors the project, ensuring it stays on track, meets deadlines, and delivers the desired results.Their responsibility is project planning, task management monitoring progress and communication.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that provides developers with tools to write, test, and debug their code. It combines essential features like code editors, compilers, debuggers, and other development tools into one platform.Their importance involves code writting and debugging and integration with other tools eg. visual studio and pycharm while A Version Control System is a tool that helps manage and track changes to the source code over time. It enables developers to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other’s work and allows easy rollback to previous versions of the code.Their main importance is tracking changes and collaboration.Example include git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Dealing with Complex Code and Architecture-As software systems grow, they can become more complex, making it hard to maintain and scale the codebase.
Strategies to Overcome:Code Reviews: Regular code reviews can help catch problems early and ensure the code is clean, readable, and maintainable.
2.Managing Time and Deadlines-Software engineers often work under tight deadlines and may struggle to prioritize tasks or estimate how long a project will take.
Strategies to Overcome:Break Tasks into Smaller Chunks: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable parts with clear deadlines. This can make progress more measurable and deadlines less daunting.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing involves testing individual components or "units" of a software application in isolation. A unit is typically a function or a method. The goal is to verify that each unit of the software performs as expected.
 Importance:
Early Bug Detection: Unit tests help identify bugs early in the development process, making them easier to fix before they affect other parts of the system.
-Integration testing focuses on checking how different modules or components of the system interact with each other. While unit tests check individual units, integration tests verify that the communication between those units works as expected.
Importance:
Ensures Component Interaction: Often, individual components work fine on their own but fail when interacting with other components. Integration testing ensures that these interactions are smooth.
-System testing involves testing the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. This type of testing is done after integration testing and before acceptance testing.
Importance:
End-to-End Validation: System testing ensures that the full software system works as expected when all components are integrated. It evaluates both functional and non-functional aspects of the system.
-Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing before the software is released to the client or end-users. It verifies whether the software meets the business requirements and whether it is ready for deployment. There are two common types of acceptance testing:
1.Alpha Testing: Performed by the development team to detect issues before releasing the product to real users.
2.Beta Testing: Performed by actual users in a real-world environment to verify if the software satisfies their needs.
Importance:
Verifies Business Requirements: It ensures the software fulfills the goals and business requirements set by the stakeholders.
Together, these testing levels provide a comprehensive approach to software quality, identifying and resolving issues at every stage of the development process, and ultimately ensuring that the software is reliable, user-friendly, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and refining the instructions (or "prompts") given to an AI model to get the best possible response. Think of it like giving clear directions to a smart assistant—how you ask the question affects the quality and accuracy of the answer you get.
Better Responses – Well-structured prompts help AI give more accurate, relevant, and useful answers. A vague question might lead to a vague response.
Efficiency – A good prompt saves time by reducing the need for back-and-forth clarifications.
Creativity & Problem-Solving – AI can generate unique ideas, but only if guided properly. A strong prompt can unlock deeper insights, better summaries, or even creative writing.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about history."
Improved Prompt:
"Give a brief overview of the major events in world history from the 20th century, focusing on wars, technological advancements, and political changes."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
More Specific – Instead of "history" (which is too broad), it narrows the focus to the 20th century and key topics like wars, technology, and politics.
Clear Expectations – The AI knows it needs to provide a brief overview rather than a deep dive into a single event.
Better Quality Response – The AI can now deliver a structured and relevant answer instead of guessing what the user wants.
Good prompt engineering makes AI responses faster, clearer, and more useful
